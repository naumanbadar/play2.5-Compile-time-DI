I created this project as a template for play 2.5 application with compile time dependency injection.

It is solely meant for writing back end services with minimal of web interface. So that I can just download and start coding rather than changing and removing stuff from play-scala template every time I start a new project.

Includes docker-compose.

# How to clone:
